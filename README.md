In the field of education, the process of assessing student performance is of great importance. Currently, this assessment is primarily done by teachers through manual evaluation. However, as the student-to-teacher ratio increases over time, this manual evaluation process becomes increasingly complex. Manual assessment has its limitations, such as being time-consuming and lacking reliability.

To address these challenges, an online examination system has emerged as an alternative to traditional pen-and-paper methods. This computer-based evaluation system is well-suited for assessing multiple-choice questions efficiently. However, when it comes to grading essays and short answers, there is still a lack of a robust evaluation system.

Recognizing these issues, we, as students, have decided to embrace these challenges and push ourselves to find a solution. Leveraging our knowledge in the field of natural language processing (NLP), we have constructed a model that follows in the footsteps of different students and researchers from around the world. In our contribution to this work, we aimed to enhance the performance of the essay grading problem. We accomplished this by extracting and analyzing various aspects of the essays in our dataset, including their relevance, structural organization, semantics, syntax, and grammar.
